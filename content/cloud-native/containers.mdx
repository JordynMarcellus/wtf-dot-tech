## WTF?

Containers, according to the Docker article explaining [what is a container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container "Article covering containers on docker.com"), can be understood as a "unit of software."

Abstracting away the OS from your service, containers become a fully-deployable, atomic unit of work that can quickly and efficiently spin up and spin down.

Containers are revolutionizing how we build software, further enabling the microservice revolution in software development. Furthermore, they provide an awesome developer experience as they package up all needed dependencies into a single source of truth that can be spun up with a simple `docker-compose up`.

Containers, alongside orchestration tools like [Kubernetes](cloud-native/kubernetes "WTF is Kubernetes?"), Docker Swarm or Amazon ECS can enable many kinds of improvements to your software development and deployment workflows.
