## WTF?

GitOps is a methodology proposed initially by [Alexis Richardson](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request "Alexis Richardson's original article on the subject") as a way of using Git as the single source of truth for a production system. To ensure consistency with the production system, diffing tools would regularly scan the system and identify any kinds of small changes made to the production system by operators.

Richardson specifically uses the term to refer to working with Kubernetes, but these kinds of principles can be extended to other tools according to [CloudBees' Juni Mukherjee](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/gitops-dev-dash-ops "GitOps: Dev with a dash of Ops!" on CloudBees.com")

## Why?

This enables simpler roll-backs/roll-forwards and allows for rebuilding entire clusters/infrastructures using declarative tools like Terraform and Kubernetes. This enables more reliable, speedy deployments and ensures when things are negatively impacted we have source-controlled configurations that allow us to quickly recover.
