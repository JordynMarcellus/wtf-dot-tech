This was originally created by [Jordyn Marcellus](https://www.jordynmarcellus.com/ "Jordyn's current website") as a way to track and understand some of the modern advances in software development technology.

This uses the **amazing** [Gatsby starter](https://github.com/hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter "Gatsby Gitbook starter github") by [Hasura](https://hasura.io/ "Hasura website") used for their learning platform, [learn.hasura.io](https://learn.hasura.io/ "Hasura's GraphQL tutorial site").

Have a suggestion? File an issue on our GitHub. Want to improve the content? Rip a PR! We're trying to help create a resource to help people discover the future of software development in a kind, compassionate and ~~~fun~~~ way!
