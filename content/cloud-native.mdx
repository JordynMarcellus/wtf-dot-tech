## WTF?

Cloud Native doesn't relate to a specific cloud provider -- Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, any other kinds of cloud environments you fancy. Instead, it's a methodology focused on how you build your web applications.

One of the basic building blocks of cloud native architectures are [containers](cloud-native/containers "Learn more about containers here"). Containers enable all sorts of fun-sounding stuff -- ephemeral environments, dynamic orchestration, immutable infrastructure.

At their core, containers -- as explained in [Docker's great article on the subject](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container "Docker.com article explaining what a container is") -- are a "unit of software." An atomic environemnt with standardized operating systems and dependencies, allowing you to deploy, scale-up and scale-down your (micro)services as needed.

## What does it enable?

Cloud native strategies allow for automated continuous deployment, elastic infrastructure -- that is, infrastructure that scales up and down based on the needs of your users -- and a re-prioiritization on building software that delivers value to users. Microservices become much more simple to scale and deploy, as each service is a container that can be deployed and scaled independently based on need.
